There are three steps in the workshop:

1. We first wire our circuit, using analog pins A4 and A2 and upload `step1.ino` to the Arduino
2. On the second part we add a threshold to trigger a reaction and we look at the ways in which having a static threshold can be problematic (a change of conditions ==> uploading new code)
3. make that threshold dynamic by reading it form a pot
